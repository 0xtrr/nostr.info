Nostr.info is a project started by Leo Wandersleb. It aims to be the
"blockchain.info" of nostr - not necessarily the blockchain.com it turned into.

Blockchain.info started out as a collection of interesting charts and
interactive tools to explore the Bitcoin blockchain and core performance
parameters and nostr.info was registered to provide something similar for the
nostr ecosystem.

The current state might be more a playground but features to come are:

- Show all events and help the user interpret them - a bit like
  [nostr.com](https://nostr.com)
- Show all relays and their features and performance - a bit like
  [nostr-registry](https://nostr-registry.netlify.app/)
- Provide a nostr client - as currently there is no good client for the browser,
  Leo is working on building one with
  [nostroid](https://github.com/Giszmo/nostroid)
- Charts
  - Events per hour/day/week
  - Split by kind/size
  - Active pubkeys per hour/day/week
  - Follows graphs - and how they change over time
